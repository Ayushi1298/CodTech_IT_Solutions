Overview of Project Task 2: Automated Report Generation
This project automates the process of generating PDF reports from CSV data files. The script reads data from a CSV file, analyzes it to calculate key statistics (total and average), and generates a well-formatted PDF report using the FPDF library. The generated report includes a summary of key statistics as well as the raw data in tabular form.

Goal:
The goal of this project is to automate the generation of a formatted PDF report based on data stored in a CSV file. The report will include:

Summary statistics such as the total and average values derived from the data.
A detailed table showing the raw data values.
The final output will be a formatted PDF report that can be saved or shared.

Important Tasks:
Read Data from a CSV File: Extract data from a CSV file.
Analyze the Data: Calculate the total and average values for a specific column of the data.
Generate a PDF Report: Create a well-structured PDF document that includes:
The total and average values.
A table with the raw data.
Save the PDF Report: Save the generated PDF report to a specified location.

Utilized Technologies:
Python: Used as the main programming language to handle data reading, processing, and PDF generation.
CSV Module: A Python module for reading data from CSV files.
FPDF: A Python library used to create PDF documents. It allows for the customization of text, layout, and table formatting in the PDF report.

Range:
Input: The script reads data from a CSV file (Toyota.csv).
Output: The script generates a PDF report (reportCodTech.pdf), which includes summary statistics and a table with the data.
The report can be customized to handle different CSV file structures, depending on the user's needs.

Benefits:
Automation: The process of generating reports is automated, reducing the need for manual intervention.
Standardization: The script generates consistent and formatted reports, improving efficiency.
Customization: The PDF can include various sections such as titles, tables, and statistics, making the reports easily customizable.
Easy to Use: The script is simple to run and can generate reports from any appropriately structured CSV file.

Drawbacks:
File Format Dependency: The script assumes that the data is structured in a particular way (i.e., the second column contains numeric values). If the structure changes, the script may need modification.
Data Quality: If the CSV file contains malformed or missing data, the script may not handle it well and could require further validation and error handling.

Important Takeaways:
Automating report generation significantly saves time and minimizes errors in the reporting process.
Using FPDF, Python can easily generate well-formatted PDF reports that are customizable and professional in appearance.
Data analysis and presentation in the form of PDFs provides clear insights into the data, such as total values and averages.

Planned Enhancements:
Error Handling: Implement better error handling to manage missing or incorrect data in the CSV file.
Additional Visualizations: Include graphs or charts (e.g., bar charts or line graphs) in the report for enhanced data visualization.
Interactive Report Generation: Add a user interface where the user can choose the input CSV file and select specific fields for analysis and reporting.
Multiple File Formats: Extend support for other file formats like Excel or JSON to be used as input data sources.

Code Breakdown:
Reading Data from CSV:
The read_data_from_csv function reads the data from the CSV file (Toyota.csv). It uses Pythonâ€™s csv.reader to process the file and store the data in a list, skipping the header row.

Data Analysis:
The analyze_data function processes the CSV data, specifically the second column. It calculates the total sum of the values and computes the average value. If any row contains invalid data, it is ignored.

PDF Report Generation:
The generate_pdf_report function creates the PDF report using FPDF. It includes:
A title ("Automated Report").
The total and average values calculated from the data.
A table displaying each row of the data (ID and value).
The report is saved as a PDF (reportCodTech.pdf).
