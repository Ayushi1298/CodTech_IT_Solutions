Overview of Project Task 1: Data Visualization and API Integration

The main goal of this project is to integrate the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve weather data and use Python tools like Matplotlib and Seaborn to visualize it.

Goal
The aim is to show how to process the data that is retrieved, integrate a public API, and produce visualizations that provide insightful information.

Important Tasks
Establishing a Python environment for data visualization and API integration.
Use the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve 5-day weather forecast data.
Retrieving and parsing the API response's temperature and humidity information.
Utilizing Matplotlib and Seaborn to visualize temperature and humidity trends throughout time.

Utilized Technologies
Python: A programming language for manipulating data and integrating APIs.
Requests: An HTTP request library for the OpenWeatherMap API.
Matplotlib: A library called Matplotlib is used to create interactive, animated, and static visualizations.
Seaborn: It is a Matplotlib-based statistical data visualization library.

Range
Retrieve current weather information for any city.
See the trends in temperature and humidity over a five-day span.
Give information on the local weather patterns.

Benefits
It shows how to use APIs for data retrieval in the real world.
It provides lucid visual information about weather patterns.
It is simple to adapt to different cities or characteristics.

Drawbacks
Restricted to the OpenWeatherMap API's data and capabilities.
Reliant on internet access to retrieve data.

Important Takeaways
Effective trend identification in weather data is facilitated by visualization.
Data processing and retrieval are made more efficient by API integration.

Planned Enhancements
Include additional weather metrics such as wind speed and precipitation levels.
Build an interactive dashboard to allow for dynamic data visualizations.
Add error handling to account for edge cases and potential API errors.
Integrate data from multiple APIs to provide a broader and more detailed weather dataset.

Code Breakdown

API Access:
The requests.get() method is used to retrieve the weather information from the API.
The request includes the API key and the target city's name as input parameters to fetch the specific data.

Data Processing:
The JSON data returned by the API is processed to pull out essential information such as dates, temperature, and humidity values.

Data Visualization:
Temperature and humidity trends are displayed using line graphs created with the help of Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries.
